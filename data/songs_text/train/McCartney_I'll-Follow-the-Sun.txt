One day, you'll look To see I've gone But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun One day, you'll know I was the one But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun And now the time has come And so, my love, I must go And though I lose a friend In the end you will know Oh-oh-oh One day, you'll find That I have gone But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun And now the time has come And so, my love, I must go And though I lose a friend In the end you will know Oh-oh-oh One day, you'll find That I have gone But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
