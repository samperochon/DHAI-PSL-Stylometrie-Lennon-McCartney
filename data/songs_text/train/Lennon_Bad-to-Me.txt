If you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely If they knew that I'd lost my one and only They'd be sad if you're bad to me The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin' If they heard form the breeze that you left me cryin' They'd be sad, don't be bad to me But I know you won't leave me 'cause you told me so And I've no intention of letting you go Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely 'Cause they know that I got my one and only They'll be glad, you're not bad to me But I know you won't leave me 'cause you told me so And I've no intention of letting you go Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely 'Cause they know that I got my one and only They'll be glad, you're not bad to me They'll be glad, you're not bad to me, to me, to me
